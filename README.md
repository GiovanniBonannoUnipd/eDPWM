# Enhanced Digital-Pulse Width Modulator (eDPWM)
This repository contains the MATLAB/Simulink implementation of the enhanced digital pulse width modulator (eDPWM) proposed in "An Innovative Digital Pulse Width Modulator and Its FPGA Implementation" (Bonanno 2025). This innovative modulator offer zero phase delay or a programmable high frequency phase boost.
